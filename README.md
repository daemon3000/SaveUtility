## Introduction
SaveUtility is an open-source save plugin for Unity 3D, designed to save entire scenes. 
SaveUtility was influenced by [UnitySerializer ](http://whydoidoit.com/unityserializer) which unfortunately hasn’t received any recent updates.

**Tested on Linux, Windows and Mac OSX. Only for Unity 4.**

## Installation
- Clone or download the project
- Open the project and export the two folders as a new unity package(you don’t have to export the examples if you don’t want to)
- Import the unity package in your game project

The package comes with examples and scripts that show you how to use the API.
